#Machine Learning algorithms
## IN supervised learning algorithms there main two types algorithm
*Regression
*Classification
**Linear Regression model is the technique based regression algorithm**
##### If there are x input data and y output data to be train to get the predicted value Ycap 
##### Its use simple straight line in graph where y(w,b)(X)= wx +b plot equation
#####linear regression works on single input variable like X.
